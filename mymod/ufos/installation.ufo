	description	"_The radar tower is an unmanned installation that can be placed anywhere in the world to boost our detection range. It is cheap to build and highly useful, but its camouflage is not very effective. Alien craft may detect the active scanning and attempt to destroy the tower once they find it. It is recommended that radar towers be protected with SAM sites."
